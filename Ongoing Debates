    <h2>In the year 1973, the Supreme Court Case Roe v. Wade had came to an agreement that abortion is a right because each individual has the right to privacy. Although, this was a moment of celebration for many, others didnâ€™t support this ruling. However, on June 27, 2022, a new Supreme Court case has overturned this decision (5-4). This means that in many states, abortions are no longer legalized unless women fall under the circumstances that allows them to get an abortion in their state.</h2>
