      height='600'><strong>Abortions have been an ongoing issue in the US for many decades. Many have separated themselves into parties based on their beliefs, “pro-choice” and “pro-life”. Pro-choice members believe that women should have the choice of choosing whether or not they want an abortion. They often protest with the phrase “My body My choice”. Whereas Pro-life believe that abortions should be made illegal. These beliefs exist for a number of reasons such as: religion, protecting life, and the belief that everyone has a right to live.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What people need to understand is that banning abortions doesn’t stop abortions. It ends safe abortions.</strong></p>
